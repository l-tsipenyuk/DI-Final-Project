1. Create a tool in react-redux to create, save, delete and edit cards - with inputs for word and for link to an image. Use a default image if the link is invalid.
2. Add a search bar based on Giphy so that users could type in the word and the image from giphy would be fetched.
3. Enable feature to show all the cards created.
4. Enable search by word to show the cards which are looked for.
5. Create node.js and set up server. Adapt post request of a card data to the server when the user clicks on "save" while creating a card (double check handling links to images).
6. Enable saving cards data in SQL database. 
7. In react create a quiz-mode from the cards created: the image from a card will be displayed and the user will type the word in the input (handle letter case). 
8. Set up a counter for correct answers. Handle max score. 
9. Make an "announcement page" with score result. 
10. Work on CSS and overall design (I plan on implementing some basic style during the work process but here I mean the overall app appearance).  Make all the pages responsive. 
11. Double-check the error handling.
12. Deploy an application.

Possible additional features (one or more could be chosen if all the above works and is completed): 
13. Enable users in quiz-mode to see the errors.
14. Make cards in Hebrew (I assume it's not that hard technically but much harder to handle in terms of design)
15. Enable users to create card decks grouped by topic.
16. Implement login/register mode (i.e. user can get his cards collection only after registration).
